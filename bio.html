<h1> What Is the Meaning Of Life? </h1>
<body>
Born in Madison, WI, Bryan Zhang is currently a junior at Tufts University studying computer engineering. Outside of classes, Bryan enjoys playing and watching soccer, watching his lava lamp, and dancing. <br/>
His culinary favorites include jalapeno chips, jalapeno pretzels, and jalape√±ns. He often spends his time daydreaming, and is an active proponent of inactivity. <br/>
In addition, he has many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany. <br/> 
His life in 3 words: Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
